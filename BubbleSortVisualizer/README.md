# 📘 Bubble Sort Visualizer

Welcome to my **Bite Size Code** series — a collection of small but meaningful projects that help me (and hopefully others!) review and understand the core concepts of **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) in a visual and practical way.

## 📍 My Journey to Learn Data Science Begins

Hello everyone! 🚀

I’m currently on a personal journey to learn **Data Science** — a field that merges statistics, programming, and problem-solving to uncover insights from data.

Before diving into complex models and analytics, I’ve chosen to go back to the fundamentals:

> 💡 **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**

These are the building blocks of every efficient system, and mastering them is key for any aspiring Data Scientist or Developer.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Review DSA concepts with fresh eyes  
- ✅ Build mini-projects that bring each concept to life  
- ✅ Create **visual explanations** — not just code, but easy-to-understand visualizations  
- ✅ Share these as "**Bite Size Code**" for devs who want to learn or review practically and visually

## 📘 Today’s Lesson: **Bubble Sort Algorithm**

### ✅ What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they’re in the wrong order — like how bubbles rise to the surface.

---

### ❓ Why was Bubble Sort invented?

Bubble Sort was designed more for **clarity and learning** than speed. It’s a beginner-friendly way to understand sorting logic and the concept of **comparisons and iterations**.

---

### ⚙️ How does it work?

1. Compare each pair of adjacent elements  
2. Swap them if they’re in the wrong order  
3. Repeat the process for all items, multiple times  
4. After each pass, the largest unsorted item “bubbles” to its correct position

---

### 🕒 When to Use It?

- For **learning and teaching** purposes  
- With **very small datasets**  
- When **simplicity** is more important than performance

---

### ✅ Pros

- Very easy to understand and implement  
- Good for teaching and beginners  
- Requires **no extra memory** (in-place sorting)

---

### ❌ Cons

- **Inefficient** for large data sets (O(n²) time complexity)  
- Not suitable for performance-critical applications

---

### 🌍 Real-World Use Cases (Small Scale)

1. Sorting student grades for manual checking  
2. Organizing short to-do lists  
3. Sorting product prices in a simple POS system  
4. Sorting cards in a card game simulation  
5. Rearranging name tags alphabetically at an event
